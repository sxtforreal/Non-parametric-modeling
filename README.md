Used time series data of daily mortality counts in Quebec to evaluate two hypothesis regarding the effect of epidemic on different age groups of people:
1. The first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in March, April and May 2020 primarily affected the over 70's (elderly). 
2. The wave of COVID-19 epidemic started in September 2020 was primarily caused by under 50's. 

Employed Bayesian inference and semi-parametric modeling of time trend to conduct the analysis.
